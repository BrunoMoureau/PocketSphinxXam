Speech Recognition with PocketSphinx in Xamarin.Forms project (only available for Android)

Here's an example of a Xamarin.Forms speech recognition project using PocketSphinx. I made it with the speech recognition engine PocketSphinx from CMUSphinx (website : https://cmusphinx.github.io/).

I compiled the library and generated the wrapper C#-C following the explanations on their website. I added the libraries (.so) to the project and wrote some logic to use it (inspirated of the java classes distributed on the website).

If you want to know more about how I built this, please look at this file : https://github.com/BrunoMoureau/PocketSphinxXam/blob/master/README%20compilation.txt.
